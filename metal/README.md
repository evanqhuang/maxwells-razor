## NOTE: PROTOTYPE UNTESTED 
This is mostly to keep track of a POC using more non-printed parts, this is not fully completed.

## BOM
- **Follow [Print settings](#print-settings) below**
- `extruder_mount.stl`
- `x_carriage.stl`
- 6x - 10mm x 2mm neodymium magnets (recommended to be N42 or N52, weaker ones won't hold the printhead securely enough)
- 3x - 4mm ball bearing
- 6x - 12mm x 3mm metal dowel

## Print settings

| File | Layer height | Walls (0.4mm nozzle) | Infill | Support | Support type | Ironing |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| `x_carriage.stl` | 0.1mm | 4 | 30% | :white_check_mark: | Normal | :white_check_mark: |  |
| `extruder_mount.stl` | 0.2mm | 4 | 30% | :white_check_mark: | Normal | :x: |

## Assembly 

Should be pretty self explanatory, you may need to heat up the bearings a little to be able to press fit them into the holes
